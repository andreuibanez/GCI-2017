# GCI2017
For all of you there that have created contents in tasks like: Google Assistant Sheets, POIS, T-Shirts and Use cases we propose that publish them on our repositories.

Task is:
- Go Github and create your user (and enter the marvels of opensource code)
If you already have one you can skip this pass.
- Go our GCI repo and ask to join the team, https://github.com/LiquidGalaxyLAB/GCI-2017 (our mentors will be accepting users with the right permissions)
- When accepted go our repository again, enter the drawer of the kind of content you've created and choose "Create new file"  option, uploading your file to the drawer. 

And yes, you can do this for every task you've created on GCI 2017, and win awareness, and maybe reach the gran prize !!! (Only tasks of: Google Assistant Sheets, POIS, T-Shirts and Use cases)

Deliverable: a screenshot published in your dashboard  with the github screen with the file on place.
